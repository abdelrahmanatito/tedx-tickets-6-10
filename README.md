in the register page i want you to add a new data field which the user can upload his own person photo with same requirements like the proof to avoid bugs for testing and add a column for it in supabase and show it in the admin and accept emails and send it through resend api and check if
itâ€™s working for others domains like icloud / outlook / yahoo / basically i want to cover most of them including gmail

in the admin page i want : 
- to see all data in the dashboard including option to see photos, proof and id of the ticket
- option to accept, decline, delete, view the proof, send the ticket, generate the ticket 
- email notification for registration and confirmation with the photo of the generated ticket
- to make search features in the admin dashboard with filtering for status of the ticket with tabs
